# Vue Project 1
## A simple text based game

This is a project I coded whilst learning from a [Vue JS course](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)

These are some of the things I learnt & practiced:

* Creating vue instances
* Rendering the instance into a div
* Storing data on the Vue instance
* Outputting data
* Using style helpers by binding onto a style property, and passing an object to change the style.
* Conditionals via v-if & v-else statements
* Event listeners via v-onclick / @click
* Writing methods
* Using v-for to loop through an array
* Binding conditionally to a css class
